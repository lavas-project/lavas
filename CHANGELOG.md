# Changelog

=======

## Lavas-core-vue [1.1.0] - 2018-1-18

### Changed

- [Fix] New version of `core/index.html.tmpl` can work with older version of lavas correctly

## Lavas-core-vue [1.0.4-rc.1] - 2018-1-17

### Changed

- [Feature] Allow developers use custom variables in `core/index.html.tmpl`
- [Fix] Developers with old version of lavas (â‰¤ 2.2.2) can use `lavas dev` correctly.

## Lavas-core-vue [1.0.2-rc.0] - 2018-1-10

### Changed

- [Feature] Add `config` option to `lavas dev`, `lavas start` and `lavas build`.
- [Feature] Lavas internal middlewares such as `static`, `service-worker`, `ssr`, `error` and `favicon` can be toggled by calling `express/koaMiddleware()`.
- [Feature] Provide `render()` function so that a custom SSR middleware can be used in SSR mode.

## Lavas-core-vue [1.0.1-rc.1] - 2018-1-8

### Changed

- [Fix] In development mode, if we detect the `publicPath` is from CDN (eg. starts with `http(s)://` or `//`), a default path `/` will be used instead. But in production mode, the CDN `publicPath` will be used as assets' prefix correctly.

## [2.1.8-rc.2] - 2018-1-3

### Changed

- [Feature] Add `build.skeleton` in config. In SPA, you can toggle skeleton feature by `build.skeleton.enable` and change `core/Skeleton.vue` with `build.skeleton.path`.
- [Feature] Inject some lines in `core/service-worker.js`:
    - Auto prefix when using `publicPath`. eg. `importScripts('${publicPath}static/js/workbox-sw.prod.v2.1.2.js');`
    - Auto add `workboxSW.router.registerNavigationRoute();` at the end of the file. You don't need to modify when switching between `SSR` and `SPA` manually.
- [Fix] Bug in switching from `SPA` to `SSR`.

## [2.1.8-rc.1] - 2018-1-2

### Changed

- [Fix] `cssExtract` in production mode.
- [Fix] Update to Webpack@3.x.
- [Breaking Change] Remove `entry` in config.

## [2.0.7-rc.4] - 2017-12-20

### Changed
- [Fix] Move `babel` option into `build` in `lavas.config.js`.
- [Feature] Use `workbox-webpack-plugin@3.0.0-alpha.3` which has following changes:
    - We don't need putting `importScript()` in front of `service-worker.js` any more.
    - Precache all assets generated by the webpack compilation. Use `chunks` instead of `globDirectory` and `globPatterns`. This will also fix the problem in development mode with `webpack-dev-middleware`.

## [2.0.7-rc.3] - 2017-12-5

### Changed
- [Fix] Make build works when BUILD_PATH in `lavas.config.js` changes to other directory.
- [Fix] Move manifest from `lavas.config.js` to single JSON file.
- [Feature] Generate `dist/lavas/routes.json` which contains all router rules.

## [2.0.7-rc.2] - 2017-12-2

### Changed
- [Fix] Those server deps required by server-side middlewares shouldn't exist in client side(main.[hash].js) and vice versa.

## [2.0.7] - 2017-11-30

### Added
- [Lavas Core] Simplify `dist/lavas/config.json` after production building, only preserve some runtime-aware options.
    ```
    // dist/lavas/config.json
    {
        build: {
            publicPath: true,
            compress: true
        },
        entry: true,
        middleware: true,
        router: true,
        errorHandler: true,
        manifest: true,
        serviceWorker: {
            swDest: true
        }
    }
    ```

### Changed
- [Fix] Make `config.defines` works and add relative test cases.
- [Fix] Merge middlewares defined in config correctly. Use `lodash.merge` to concat two arrays during merging.
- [Fix] `config.router` use different strategies under the following scenes:
    - Apply `rewrite.from` to `route.path`.
    - Apply `routes.pattern` to `route.fullPath`.
- [Fix] Simplify `dist/config.json` after production building, only preserve some required options.

## [2.0.5] - 2017-11-29

### Added
- Use coveralls for keeping test coverage history. Also integrate it with travis.
- [Lavas CLI] Add `lavas dev/start/build` command.
- [Lavas Core] Require some Koa's deps such as some middlewares conditionally so that it can run in node < 7.6.0. If users want to use `koaMiddleware`, they must upgrade their node.
- Add a common test case. It will test for Koa when node >= 7.6.0 and express otherwise.

### Changed
- [Fix] Use vue-loader@13.0.2 for Node 5.x. The latest vue-loader already drops support for Node 4.x.[ISSUE](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/issues/1010)
- [Fix] express-error.js use `302` rather than `301` as redirect status code.
- [Fix] Rebuild when lavas.config.js changed.
